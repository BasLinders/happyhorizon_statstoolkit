    - Interaction Effect calculator: Verify if your experiments negatively impacted eachother or not
    - SRM calculator: Identify if your visitors were distributed as expected in your experiment
    - Sample Size / MDE calculator: See how long your experiment has to run to reach an effect before you can draw conclusions

    ### How to Use
    - Select a page from the dropdown to view different tools.
    - Each page contains a single tool for the purposes described above.
